# Flat-Fridge
Living in a flat with 6 people our fridge fills up fast. When it’s full the problem compounds, as people can’t find previously purchased items, so they just buy more. 
This leads to finding gross foods that have been left in the fridge for way too long. I wanted to make an application to help people living in a flat easily keep track of their food.
Flat Fridge is an Android application allowing people to easily tack what they have in their fridge, by taking photos and recording the expiry date of items.
